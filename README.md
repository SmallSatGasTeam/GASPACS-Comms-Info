# GASPACS CubeSat Communications Information
GASPACS is a 1U CubeSat designed, developed, and completed by undergraduate students on the Get Away Special team at Utah State University.

GASPACS stands for **G**et **A**way **S**pecial **P**assive **A**ttitude **C**ontrol **S**atellite. The satellite is a technology demonstration for an inflatable boom structure that will double as a passive attitude stabilization device due to the aerodynamic drag in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). 

GASPACS was launched on 12/21/2021 on SpaceX CRS-24. GASPACS is currently aboard the International Space Station (ISS), with deployment into orbit via the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD) scheduled for the week of 1/24/2022. This page will be updated after deployment with information on tracking GASPACS and ongoing mission operations.
